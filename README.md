### DefinitelyTyped
The repository for Overwolf TypeScript type definition.

Type definition files allow you to provide type information for JavaScript code that is by itself (by its very nature) not statically typed. The file extension for such a file is “d.ts”, where d stands for definition. Type definition files make it possible to enjoy the benefits of type checking, autocompletion, and member documentation.

Even if your application uses plain JavaScript and no TypeScript at all, you can use the type definition files for autocompletion and documentation purposes. Simply include them in your Visual Studio Code project. will then include the found types in its auto-completion list, given that you've got TypeScript installed.

Of course, you won't get the benefit of type checking because you're not actually using TypeScript, but still, the provided information can be very helpful for working with the dynamic and loosely typed language that is JavaScript.
